# ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions

This GitHub repository showcases my ability to build a complex machine learning model using TensorFlow and demonstrates my aptitude in various libraries and techniques, including Keras Tuner for hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and dropout. The purpose of this repository is to highlight my skills and expertise to potential employers in the field of machine learning and data science.

## Competition Overview

The goal of the Kaggle competition, ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions, is to predict if a person has any of three specific medical conditions. The competition aims to develop predictive models that can accurately identify these conditions based on measurements of health characteristics. By leveraging data science techniques, the objective is to expedite the diagnosis process while maintaining patient privacy.

## Dataset and Problem Statement

The dataset provided for this competition consists of measurements of health characteristics, which serve as input features for training the predictive model. Each observation in the dataset is labeled as either Class 0 (indicating the absence of any medical condition) or Class 1 (indicating the presence of one or more of the three medical conditions).

## Model Architecture

In this project, I have implemented a wide and deep model using the Keras Subclassing API. The wide and deep architecture allows the model to capture both shallow and deep relationships within the data, enabling better predictive performance. To optimize the model architecture, I utilized the Keras Tuner library, which automatically searches for the best combination of hyperparameters such as the number of layers, neurons, optimizer, weight decay, and dropout rate.

To mitigate overfitting due to the limited size of the training data (500 entries), I incorporated regularization techniques such as weight decay and dropout. Weight decay helps control the complexity of the model by penalizing large weights, while dropout introduces randomness during training, preventing the model from relying too heavily on specific features.

## Callbacks and Techniques

To further enhance the model's training process and performance, I employed several callbacks and techniques, including:

- **TensorBoard**: I utilized TensorBoard, a visualization tool provided by TensorFlow, to monitor and analyze the model's training progress. It enables visualizing metrics, such as loss and accuracy, as well as the model's architecture.

- **Early Stopping**: I implemented early stopping, a technique that monitors a specific metric (e.g., validation loss) during training and stops the training process if the metric stops improving. This helps prevent overfitting and saves computational resources.

- **Model Checkpoints**: I used model checkpoints to save the best model weights during training based on a chosen metric (e.g., validation loss). This allows me to restore the model to its best state even if the training process is interrupted.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following files and directories:

- **notebooks**: This directory includes Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Conclusion

By participating in the ICR - Identifying Age-Related Conditions Kaggle competition and developing a wide and deep model using TensorFlow, Keras Tuner, and various techniques, I have demonstrated my ability to tackle complex machine learning problems. The repository serves as a showcase of my skills and proficiency in libraries like TensorFlow and techniques like hyperparameter tuning, regularization, and dropout. I hope this repository highlights my aptitude to potential employers in the field of machine learning and data science.
